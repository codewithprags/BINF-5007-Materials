This is a public Repo for course material for the BINF 5507 Course at Humber Polytechnic, 2025.

Inside are the Labs and Projects for the Machine Learning and AI course for Clinical Bioinformatics at Humber Polytechnic.

Assignment 1. Data Preprocessing for Simple Model Evaluation of Messy Data - 
----MESSY_DATA --> Sample/Modified Heart Diease Patients 
----Clean_data --> Processed patient data prepared for linear regression model

Assignment 2. Linear and Correlational Models for Heart Disease data with data preprocessing.
----heart_disease_uci --> raw data from UCI containing patient information regarding heart disease amongst various other features.
Linear regression model for predicting Cholesterol levels in patients.
Logistic regression model, and knn_logistic regression model are used to model disease state as a binary classification.
Heatmaps, AROC, and AUPRC are used to visualize the findings of the most optimal configuration obtained using gridsearch and cross-validation methods.
